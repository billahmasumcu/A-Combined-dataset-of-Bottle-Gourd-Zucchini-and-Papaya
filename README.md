1. DATASET DESCRIPTION

This dataset contains high-resolution images of healthy and diseased leaves for three major crops: Bottle-Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo), and Papaya (Carica papaya). 

The dataset was created to facilitate research in AI-driven agricultural disease detection, computer vision, and machine learning.

- Total Original Images: 2,144
- Total Augmented Images: 23,000 (Expanded to ~1,000 images per class)
- Number of Classes: 23
- Location: Daffodil International University Smart City (GPS: 23.8769° N, 90.3113° E) and agricultural fields in Bangladesh.
- Capture Device: SONY ALPHA 7 II (Full-frame camera).
- Validation: Verified by 3 senior agronomists using majority voting consensus.


2. FOLDER STRUCTURE

The dataset is organized into two main directories: "Original_Images" and "Augmented_Images". Inside each, images are sorted by Crop Name and then by Disease Class.

3. METHODOLOGY & AUGMENTATION DETAILS

> Image Acquisition: 
Captured under natural lighting conditions (Morning: 08:00–11:00 AM & Afternoon: 03:00–05:00 PM) to capture realistic variability.

> Pre-processing & Augmentation:
Software used: Python (v3.9) with OpenCV and PIL (Pillow) libraries.
All images were resized to 512x512 pixels. The following augmentation parameters were applied to address class imbalance:

- Rotation: Random rotation of ±15° and ±30°.
- Zoom/Scaling: Random scaling factors of 1.1x and 1.3x.
- Flipping: Horizontal and Vertical flipping.
- Brightness/Color: Random adjustment factors between 0.7 and 1.3.
- Shifting: Translation along x and y axes by ±10 pixels.
- Cropping: Center cropping at ratios of 0.6 and 0.8.


4. FILE USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

- For Training: Use the 'Augmented_Images' folder for training deep learning models (CNNs, ViTs, etc.) to ensure class balance.
- For Testing/Validation: It is recommended to use a split from the 'Original_Images' folder to test model performance on real-world non-augmented data.
- Metadata: Refer to 'metadata.csv' to filter images based on lighting conditions or capture time.
